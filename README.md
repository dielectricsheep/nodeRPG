#gridRPG

##What is it?
nodeRPG is currently the beginnings of a retro styled RPG engine with frontend and backend written in Javascript for HTML5 canvas.  Right now it only supports very basic functions, but I will continue to extend it to become a full featured and flexible online MMORPG style RPG tile engine.

The web site and display engine is served through express, and map data is streamed via socket.io.

##TODO:

Everything.  Need to move map and player data to MongoDB, and login authentication logic.  Also, need to tweak front end to allow multiple players, add chat, etc, etc.  This is just a start.
